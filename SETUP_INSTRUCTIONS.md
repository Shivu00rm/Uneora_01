# FlowStock Production Setup Instructions

## 1. Supabase Database Setup

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new project
3. Wait for the project to be ready
4. Copy your Project URL and API Key (anon key)

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### Step 3: Run Database Migrations
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and run the contents of `supabase_migrations/001_initial_setup.sql`
4. Verify all tables were created successfully

### Step 4: Create Test Users
1. Go to Authentication > Users in your Supabase dashboard
2. Create the following test users:
   - **admin@flowstock.com** (password: admin123) - Super Admin
   - **admin@techcorp.com** (password: admin123) - Org Admin  
   - **user@techcorp.com** (password: user123) - Org User

### Step 5: Insert User Profiles
1. After creating the auth users, copy their UUIDs
2. Update the UUIDs in `supabase_migrations/002_seed_users.sql`
3. Run the seed script in the SQL Editor

## 2. Authentication Flow Testing

### Login Credentials for Testing:
- **Super Admin**: admin@flowstock.com / admin123
- **Org Admin**: admin@techcorp.com / admin123
- **Org User**: user@techcorp.com / user123

### Expected Behavior:
- **Super Admin** → Redirects to `/super-admin`
- **Org Admin/User** → Redirects to `/app/dashboard`
- **Unauthorized access** → Shows proper error page
- **Loading states** → Displays during authentication

## 3. Row Level Security (RLS) Verification

The database includes comprehensive RLS policies:
- Users can only access their organization's data
- Super admins can access all data
- Org admins can manage users in their organization
- Proper audit logging for all actions

## 4. API Integrations

### Shopify Integration (Example)
```typescript
// Example integration setup
const shopifyConfig = {
  shop_domain: "your-shop.myshopify.com",
  access_token: "your-shopify-token"
};
```

### Security Notes:
- All API credentials are stored encrypted in the database
- Integration status monitoring included
- Proper error handling for failed connections

## 5. Deployment Setup

### Netlify Environment Variables:
Set these in your Netlify dashboard:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
VITE_PUBLIC_BUILDER_KEY=your-builder-key
```

### Build Commands:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist/spa`
- **Functions Directory**: `netlify/functions`

## 6. Error Handling & Monitoring

### Production Error Handling:
- Error boundaries catch React errors
- Supabase errors are handled gracefully
- Loading states prevent infinite loops
- Clear error messages for users

### Monitoring Setup:
- All authentication events are logged
- Audit logs track user actions
- System alerts for critical issues
- Performance monitoring included

## 7. Mobile App Considerations

The authentication system works for both web and mobile:
- Token-based authentication
- Automatic session refresh
- Offline capability considerations
- Role-based UI rendering

## 8. Security Checklist

✅ Row Level Security enabled on all tables
✅ Proper role-based access control
✅ Encrypted API credentials storage
✅ Audit logging for all actions
✅ Session management with auto-refresh
✅ Protection against common vulnerabilities
